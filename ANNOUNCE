	    Multiple Precision One-Dimensional Root-Finding
	    ===============================================


This  package   installs  a   C  language  library   reimplementing  the
one-dimensional root-finding algorithms from  the GNU Scientific Library
using the multiple precision numbers defined by MPFR and MPFI.

  This  package  depends  upon  the following  packages:  GMP,  the  GNU
Multiple  Precision arithmetic  library;  MPFR,  the Multiple  Precision
Floating-Point   Reliable   library;   MPFI,  the   Multiple   Precision
Floating-Point Interval library.

  The package  makes use  of the  GNU Autotools  and it  is tested  on a
GNU+Linux  system.   It is  distributed  under  the GNU  General  Public
License version 3.0.

  The latest version of this package can be downloaded from:
