1. Introduction
---------------

This  package installs  a  C language  library  implementing a  template
library.

  The package  makes use  of the  GNU Autotools  and it  is tested  on a
GNU+Linux system.

3. Install
----------

First we have to install the packages: GMP, MPFR, MPFI.

  To install from a proper release tarball, do this:

    $ cd mp-odrf-0.1.0
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ ../configure
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

to inspect the available configuration options:

    $ ../configure --help

  From  a repository  checkout or  snapshot  (the ones  from the  Github
site): we  must install the  GNU Autotools (GNU Automake,  GNU Autoconf,
GNU Libtool),  then we must first  run the script "autogen.sh"  from the
top source directory, to generate the needed files:

    $ cd mp-odrf
    $ sh autogen.sh

we  should   now  see   the  executable   "configure"  script   and  the
"Makefile.in" file.  From now on everything  is the same as for building
from a proper release tarball, but we have to run the "configure" script
enabling the maintainer mode:

    $ ../configure --enable-maintainer-mode [options]
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

  The  Makefile supports  the  DESTDIR environment  variable to  install
files in a temporary location, example: to see what will happen:

    $ make -n install DESTDIR=/tmp/mp-odrf

to really do it:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/template

  After the installation it is  possible to verify the installed library
against the test suite with:

    $ make installcheck


4. Usage
