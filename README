1. Introduction
---------------

This  package   installs  a   C  language  library   reimplementing  the
one-dimensional root-finding algorithms from  the GNU Scientific Library
(GSL) using the multiple precision numbers defined by MPFR.

  This  package  depends  upon  the following  packages:  GMP,  the  GNU
Multiple  Precision arithmetic  library;  MPFR,  the Multiple  Precision
Floating-Point Reliable library.

  Both the code and the documentation are reworked from the original GSL
distribution;  however this  package does  not depend  on the  GSL being
installed.

  The package  makes use  of the  GNU Autotools  and it  is tested  on a
GNU+Linux system.

  NOTE The last  time the maintainer bothered to  update this paragraph,
he had tested with: GMP version 6.0.0, MPFR version 3.1.2.

3. Install
----------

First we have to install the packages: GMP, MPFR.

  To install from a proper release tarball, do this:

    $ cd mp-odrf-0.1.0
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ ../configure
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

to inspect the available configuration options:

    $ ../configure --help

  From  a repository  checkout or  snapshot  (the ones  from the  Github
site): we  must install the  GNU Autotools (GNU Automake,  GNU Autoconf,
GNU Libtool),  then we must first  run the script "autogen.sh"  from the
top source directory, to generate the needed files:

    $ cd mp-odrf
    $ sh autogen.sh

we  should   now  see   the  executable   "configure"  script   and  the
"Makefile.in" file.  From now on everything  is the same as for building
from a proper release tarball, but we have to run the "configure" script
enabling the maintainer mode:

    $ ../configure --enable-maintainer-mode [options]
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

  The  Makefile supports  the  DESTDIR environment  variable to  install
files in a temporary location, example: to see what will happen:

    $ make -n install DESTDIR=/tmp/mp-odrf

to really do it:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/mp-odrf

  After the installation it is  possible to verify the installed library
against the test suite with:

    $ make installcheck


4. Usage
--------

Read the documentation.


A. Credits
----------

The stuff was  written by Marco Maggi, rewriting the  original code from
the GSL.  If this package exists  it's because of the great GNU software
tools that he uses all the time.

  GSL is  Copyright Free Software  Foundation.  It  is the work  of many
people, and it  is maintained by the  GSL Team; see the  AUTHORS file in
the GSL distribution.

  MPFR is Copyright  Free Software Foundation, Inc.   Contributed by the
Arenaire and Cacao projects, INRIA.  It  is the work of many people, and
it  is currently  maintained  (mainly) by  Paul  Zimmermann and  Vincent
Lefevre.
